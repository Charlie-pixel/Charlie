# Experimenting with image processing
The purpose of this project is to allow users to process images through a variey of methods like 
blurring, and sharpening. An image is put into one of the folders with its name typed into the 
source code for processing. Simply adding an image into a folder i.e. Image Blur or Image 
Sharpening folders and inserting image name into the source code does the trick when the respective
program is executed.
